# HvA Java Practical Assignment for OOP2

This project is a JavaFX application that implements a master-detail functionality.
The application displays a list of people with flight tickets.
The previous version did not use Java Modules.
This version uses recent Java standards and utilizes Java Modules, jlink, and jpackage to generate a runtime image and an installer.

## Demo

## Packaging for Windows

Use the PowerShell script `.\package.ps1` to automatically generate an installer for Windows.
The script performs several steps, including building a runtime image with jlink and creating an application image with jpackage.

### Version Management

To change the app version, update the version in the following file:

- `pom.xml`

### Packaging process (Windows build script)

The script executes the following steps in order:

1. Resolve folders
2. Clean up previous build
3. Read version from pom.xml
4. Prepare out/ and package/
5. Run Maven clean -Pall  (wipes target etc.)
6. Run jlink (creates target\JRE)
7. Move runtime image out of target *before* any further clean
8. Now run Maven package to build fat‑JAR (won’t touch $JreDst)
9. Build input‑dir with fat‑JAR only
10. Run jpackage
11. Remove temporary input‑dir
12. Delete target and JRE
13. Generate Inno Setup script beside this script

## Testing the Installer

There are several recommended methods for testing the installer:

1. **Virtual Machine**:
    - Use virtualization software like VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V
    - Create a clean Windows 10 or 11 test environment
    - Install the application and verify functionality

2. **Separate User Account**:
    - Create a new local user account on your Windows machine
    - Install the application in this separate account
    - Test the full installation and application functionality

3. **Staging Computer**:
    - Use a dedicated test computer or a spare machine
    - Perform a clean installation and thorough testing

### Testing Best Practices

- Verify the installer runs without errors
- Check that the application launches correctly
- Test all main features of the application
- Confirm that user data is preserved between updates

Note: In the `data` folder, you'll find dummy data for the app (for each data type). When testing, you can copy this data to the `%APPDATA%\Remzi Cavdar\HvA OOP2 practicumopdracht` directory to simulate a real-world scenario.

## System Requirements

### User Requirements

- Operating System: Windows 10 or higher (64-bit only)

### Development Requirements

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) with JavaFX support
- Maven
- Inno Setup (for creating Windows installers)
